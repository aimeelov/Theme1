Building a Shopify theme from scratch

For this project I built a basic theme from scratch using bootstrap. My main goal was to build out the theme and then convert the themplates into JSON files to coincide with the new Shopify 2.0 theme structure. That being said, I only utilized a small amount of custom styling. 

I created a few different branches to work on specic features and then merged them back into the main branch, that I also have synced to a developmemt store. I also created a Project to help track migrating the site templates.
